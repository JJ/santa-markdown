# Dear Santa

I have been a good boy so I want you to bring me a collection of scythes and an ocean liner with a captain and a purser and a time travel machine and instructions to operate it and I know I haven't been so good at times but that is why I'm asking the time machine so that I can make it good and well and also find out what happened on July 13th which I completely forgot.
